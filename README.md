There are two parts to this exercise, one to extract data via API and another to analyse the data.

Skills to practice:
1) Using Youtube API to extract required details from multiple Youtubers and their videos for analysis
2) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore trends and patterns in relation to the success of videos of Youtubers of varying sizes
